# Noctora

This is a Noctora City server plugin. Currently, it consists of the following features :

- Simple Scoreboard system
- ATM/Bank system, which uses MariaDB database system.

In the future, we plan to implement the following features :

- Trails (for donators)
- Drivers License (for trains, possibly cars in the future)
- Several popular games implemented in Minecraft (via external plugin)
    - Monopoly
    - Snakes & Ladders

Feel free to DM me on Discord some ideas on what I can code next to be implemented to the server.
